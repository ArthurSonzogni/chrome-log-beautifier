 * Send a request to remove one or more topics at the server.  The topics to
 * remove will depend upon the nature of the topic selector specified. If the
 * selector does not have descendant pattern qualifiers (i.e. / or //), only
 * those topics that exist at paths indicated by the selector will be removed
 * and not their descendants. If a single / qualifier is specified, all
 * descendants of the matching topic paths will be removed. If // is
 * specified, all branches of the topic tree that match the selector (i.e
 * topics at the selected paths and all descendants of the selected paths)
 * will be removed.
 *
 * @param session       The current session. If NULL, this function returns immediately.
 * @param params        Parameter structure describing which topics to remove
 *                      and callbacks to handle success or failure
 *                      notifications.
