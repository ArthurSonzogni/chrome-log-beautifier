 * amount of time (\ref DIFFUSION_DEFAULT_RECONNECT_TIMEOUT) before giving up.
 *
 * Otherwise, retries will continue for (retry_count * retry_delay) seconds unless
 * explicitly overridden with reconnection_strategy_set_timeout().
 *
 * @param retry_count   The number of attempts to make.
 * @param retry_delay   The time between connection attempts, in milliseconds,
 *                      or 0 to request the system default timeout.
